# cpp-text-adventure
A simple codecademy project for practicing C++. This project is intended to be a text based game that can accessed in a terminal environment.

# Game prompt
You find yourself in an empty dirt patch in the middle of the wilderness, you don't remember what happened, but you feel something is wrong...

You must navigate the forest and evade whatever lurks in the shadows, remember that every step you take requires extreme caution. May you make it out and return safely...

# Project Status:
After learning Git procedure, this project is on hold indefinitely. For now I will be focused on Rustlings and Google's Comprehensive Rust course
